## What is this?

So there is guy named Kamlesh Tiwari supposedly , we know a lot about him from Social media, i mean everything on Social Media is manufactured about him now, almost everything about him is going to be false.


## Lets go back in time 

Ok, now this guy founded a sect politically motivated, named as Hindu Samaj Party. 

1. If we observe all of his images from Google you will find some similarity, 

Ayodha, Ram Mandir, Islam Mukt Bharat, Pakistan,Kashmir, Kerala.

The above keywords can be OCRed from the Hindu Samaj Party banners.

Cleary he was not interested in important issues , he might be a force usually political parties use , so one model is where one large entity 
puts resources to propagate all of the agendas at grassroot level using such agents.

These agents puts ideas and clearly have no understanding of whatsoever is factual reality , since observation and deduction of reality is clouted , by the sectism.

2. He was promoting divisive religion 

Religion does not divide anyone , since his understanding of religion is purely based on identification of his own best truth and trying to generalise that. Clearly he has been 
targeting muslim. 

3. Claims about prophet

Those claims clearly describes the mentality of the person and character of the person.

4. Inciting 

This clearly is a situation of inciting / provocation of sort.

5. Giving firepower 

As we know now on social media this issue will be cooked for few days, the average lifespan of this issue is going to be around 20 Days and then it will reach in TV where more
and more people like us will be brainwashed.

6. Don't treat him because he does not deserve anything

People like him should not be listened, giving him/ or his opinion is providing his message a fodder. Taking part in his mentality describes the character and image we want to have.


Now given the fact there are more issues, like PMC bank, Climate change, Hunger, Education. 

Nor Ram , Hindu or Niether Allah is going to come and solve the critial issues, it is just us and us.
